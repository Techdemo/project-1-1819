### preface
The oba sheet music app is a way to search, view and save digitalized sheet music. The sheet music is coming from the public libary of Amsterdam.
At this moment, sheet music isn't digitalized yet. So I made this prototype to prove what the future benefits could be of making your sheet music digital available.

### The app
As I've mentioned in the preface, this app is a prototype. So you will find that some functionalities won't work.
The webapp is requesting data from the oba api, the search results consists of real data from the oba api.
The render of the score comes from the Flat io api. Flat Io is a service in which the user can create and store musicsheets. Using musicXML, flat io can play the sheet music in the browser. Also it is possible to make use of a metronome or play different parts of the music sheet.

### verdict
Thanks to @maanlamp for making the oba wrapper. The wrapper enables us to request data in a format that is workable. The original Oba api is a disaster to work with, so the wrapper made it awesome to work with the api.

I think it would be cool to work on this webapp for real!
So OBA, if you think this concept and webapp can be implemented for production. You can find me at info@marcelfleuren.nl
